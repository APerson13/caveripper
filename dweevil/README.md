# Dweevil - Caveripper for Web via WASM

# Building and Running
1. In `dweevil/www`, run `npm run start`. You only have to do this once - changes will hot-reload afterwards.
2. In another terminal window, run `wasm-pack build` in `dweevil` every time you change Rust code.
3. Connect at `localhost:8080`
